## Bio

Brazillian **Computer Science** Student with years of working knowledge on programming. 

## Main Projects

During these years I have made many personal projects focusing on trying to fix social isolation and making people find new friend groups with common interests that are near them. One example can be found here: [HobbyFriends](https://github.com/adeirjunior/HobbyFriends)

I have also developed a platform which objective is provide a space for politicians and voters interact with each others hoping that it would bring more transparency on the doing of politicians: It can be found here: [E-Gab](https://egab.online)
